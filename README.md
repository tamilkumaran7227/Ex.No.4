## **Scenario and Use Case**  
**Scenario:** The manufacturing industry is looking to reduce manual monitoring and increase efficiency through automation.  
**Use Case:** IoT devices and embedded controllers are used to automate equipment, monitor performance, and enable predictive maintenance.  
**Target Audience:** Manufacturing companies (automotive, electronics, food processing).  
**Objectives:**  
- Improve production efficiency by 30%.  
- Minimize machinery downtime with predictive maintenance.  
- Enable real-time monitoring and remote control.  
- Reduce energy consumption through optimized processes.  


## **PROCEDURE**


### **1. Comparative Analysis Prompt**  
**Prompt:**  
*"Compare and contrast IoT-based automation and traditional manual monitoring in manufacturing."*  

**ChatGPT:**  
IoT-based automation allows real-time data collection, predictive maintenance, and remote monitoring. It reduces human error and downtime. Traditional manual monitoring requires human operators, is slower, and lacks predictive capabilities.  

**Gemini:**  
IoT automation gives live data and predictive alerts, while manual monitoring depends on workers physically checking machines. IoT is faster and reduces errors, but manual monitoring is cheaper and simple for small setups.  
 

### **2. Experiential Perspective Prompt**  
**Prompt:**  
*"As a factory manager, explain the benefits of predictive maintenance through IoT devices."*  

**ChatGPT:**  
As a factory manager, predictive maintenance helps me avoid costly breakdowns, schedule repairs before failures, and keep production running smoothly. It reduces downtime and increases worker confidence.  

**Gemini:**  
From a manager’s view, predictive maintenance saves money, prevents sudden stoppages, and ensures machines last longer. It also reduces stress of unexpected breakdowns.  

 

### **3. Everyday Functioning Prompt**  
**Prompt:**  
*"Describe how IoT-based monitoring improves daily factory operations like energy usage and machine control."*  

**ChatGPT:**  
IoT systems track machine energy consumption in real time, helping reduce waste. Managers can remotely control equipment, turn off idle machines, and schedule operations for maximum efficiency.  

**Gemini:**  
IoT monitoring shows which machines use more power and allows remote switching. It helps workers manage energy and control operations from a dashboard.  

 

### **4. Universal Prompt Structures**  
**Prompt:**  
*"Explain predictive maintenance in simple terms with an example."*  

**ChatGPT:**  
Predictive maintenance means fixing machines before they break down. For example, if a machine shows unusual vibration, IoT sensors alert engineers to repair it early, preventing bigger damage.  

**Gemini:**  
Predictive maintenance is checking machines in advance. Example: If sensors detect overheating, repairs are done before the machine stops working.  

 

### **5. Prompt Size Limitations**  
**Prompt:**  
*"List 20 applications of IoT in manufacturing."*  
(Handled in smaller chunks: *"List 5 applications of IoT in manufacturing."*)  

**ChatGPT:**  
1. Predictive maintenance  
2. Real-time monitoring  
3. Energy optimization  
4. Inventory tracking  
5. Remote machine control  

**Gemini:**  
1. Smart sensors for machines  
2. Remote monitoring  
3. Quality control  
4. Worker safety alerts  
5. Energy usage tracking

## **Conclusion**  
This experiment demonstrated five prompt types for an IoT-based manufacturing automation use case.  
- **ChatGPT** provided highly detailed and complete responses with strong clarity.  
- **Gemini** gave concise and relevant responses, though slightly less detailed.  
Using rubrics, ChatGPT scored higher on completeness, while Gemini scored well on efficiency and brevity.  

 

## **Result**  
The prompts were successfully executed using two AI tools. Their outputs were compared, and the evaluation showed that both tools generate useful results, with ChatGPT excelling in depth and Gemini in conciseness.
